German BIC database
--------------------------------------------------------------

This SQL table contains 4038 entries.
The data is generated by me from the Bundesbank Files.

Each table row contains:
 - The german BIC (BLZ)
 - The name of the associated bank
 - The Swiftcode / BIC

This table and the data in it is believed to be in the public
domain. If you'd like to submit changes or updates, feel
free to drop me a line at kontakt@mstaatz.de.
